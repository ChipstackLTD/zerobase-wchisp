# WCHISP TOOL

This tool is extracted from stable version at `https://github.com/ch32-rs/wchisp`

We need to extract zip, tar.gz packages from original Releases in order to serve Zerobase Arduino Core

This tool is for Zerobase 2 or other boards powered by CH32V203 (can perform USB bootloader)

**Note:** Zerobase2 need WinUSB driver that can be installed by Zadig. If we use a GUI software [WCHISPStudio](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/WCHISPTool_Setup_exe.html), the setup can install driver (CH34 or somethings else) that works for WCHISPStudio only but not work for wchisp tool from `https://github.com/ch32-rs/wchisp`. So lets install WinUSB driver and bind it to our Zerobase2 hardware (thanks to Zadig).
